# Data Structures Summary

At this point, we already checked lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. We know how to create them, access their elements, and modify them. We also learned about the differences between mutable and immutable data structures. Now, let's summarize the key points about each data structure:

First of all, you need to remember that indexing starts at 0 in Python, so the first element of a data structure is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

## Summary of Data Structures

### Definitions

- **String**: A sequence of characters (not a data structure) enclosed in quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change their content after creation. You can create a string using single quotes `'`, double quotes `"`, or triple quotes `'''` or `"""`.
- **List**: An ordered collection of items that can contain duplicates. Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation. You can create a list using square brackets `[]`.
- **Tuple**: An ordered collection of items that can contain duplicates, similar to lists, but tuples are immutable. You can create a tuple using parentheses `()`.
- **Set**: An unordered and unindexed collection of unique items. Sets are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation. You can create a set using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor.
- **Dictionary**: A collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are mutable, and you can change their content after creation. You can create a dictionary using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs or the `dict()` constructor.

### Adding Elements

- **String**: You cannot add elements to a string since it is immutable. You can concatenate strings using the `+` operator.
- **List**: You can add elements using the `append()`, `insert()`, or `extend()` methods.
- **Tuple**: You cannot add elements to a tuple since it is immutable. You can concatenate tuples using the `+` operator.
- **Set**: You can add elements using the `add()` method or the `update()` method to add multiple elements. 
- **Dictionary**: You can add key-value pairs using the assignment operator `=` or the `update()` method.

### Accessing Elements
- **String**: You can access characters using indexing (e.g., `string[0]`) or slicing (e.g., `string[1:4]`).
- **List**: You can access elements using indexing (e.g., `list[0]`) or slicing (e.g., `list[1:4]`).
- **Tuple**: You can access elements using indexing (e.g., `tuple[0]`) or slicing (e.g., `tuple[1:4]`).
- **Set**: You cannot access elements by index since sets are unordered. You can check for membership using the `in` keyword    (e.g., `element in set`).
- **Dictionary**: You can access values using keys (e.g., `dict['key']`). You can also access all keys using `dict.keys()`, all values using `dict.values()`, and all key-value pairs using `dict.items()`.

### Removing Elements
- **String**: You cannot remove elements from a string since it is immutable. You can create a new string without the unwanted characters using slicing or the `replace()` method.
- **List**: You can remove elements using the `remove()` method, `pop()` method, or `del` statement.
- **Tuple**: You cannot remove elements from a tuple since it is immutable. You can create a new tuple without the unwanted elements using slicing or concatenation.
- **Set**: You can remove elements using the `remove()` method, `discard()` method, or `pop()` method.
- **Dictionary**: You can remove key-value pairs using the `pop()` method or the `del` statement.
